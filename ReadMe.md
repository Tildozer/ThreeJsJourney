# ThreeJs Journey

## **Chapter 1**: *Basics*

### 1.1: **First Scene**

[Scene](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/scenes/Scene)

    Scenes allow you to set up what and where is to be rendered by three.js.
    This is where you place objects, lights and cameras.

[BoxGeomtery](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/geometries/BoxGeometry)

    BoxGeometry is a geometry class for a rectangular cuboid with a given 'width', 'height', and 'depth'.
    On creation, the cuboid is centred on the origin, with each edge parallel to one of the axes.

[MeshBasicMaterial](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/materials/MeshBasicMaterial)

    A material for drawing geometries in a simple shaded (flat or wireframe) way.
    This material is not affected by lights.

[Color](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/math/Color)

    Class representing a color.
    Iterating through a Color instance will yield its components (r, g, b) in the corresponding order.

[Mesh](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/objects/Mesh)

    Class representing triangular polygon mesh based objects.
    Also serves as a base for other classes such as SkinnedMesh.

[PerspectiveCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/cameras/PerspectiveCamera)

    Camera that uses perspective projection.

    This projection mode is designed to mimic the way the human eye sees.
    It is the most common projection mode used for rendering a 3D scene.

[WebGLRenderer](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/renderers/WebGLRenderer)

    The WebGL renderer displays your beautifully crafted scenes using WebGL.

### 1.2: **Transforming Objects**

[Object3D](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/core/Object3D)

    This is the base class for most objects in three.js and provides a set of properties and methods for manipulating objects in 3D space.

[Vector3](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/Vector3)

    Class representing a 3D vector. A 3D vector is an ordered triplet of numbers (labeled x, y, and z), which can be used to represent a number of things, such as:
        • A point in 3D space
        • A direction and length in 3D space
        • Any arbitrary orderd triplet of numbers.

[AxesHelper](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/helpers/AxesHelper)

    An axis object to visualize the 3 axes in a simple way.
    The X axis is red. The Y axis is green. The Z axis is blue.

[Euler](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/math/Euler)

    A class representing Euler Angles.
    Euler angles describe a rotational transformation by rotating an object on its various axes in specified amounts per axis, and a specified axis order.

[Quaternion](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/math/Quaternion)

    Implementation of a quaternion.
    Quaternions are used in three.js to represent rotations.

    Iterating through a Quaternion instance will yield its components (x, y, z, w) in the corresponding order.

[Group](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/objects/Group)

    This is almost identical to an Object3D. Its purpose is to make working with groups of objects syntactically clearer.

### 1.3: **Animations**

[clock](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/core/Clock)

    Object for keeping track of time.
    This uses performance.now() if it is available, otherwise it reverts to the less accurate Date.now().

### 1.4: **Cameras**

[Camera](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/cameras/Camera)

    Abstract base class for cameras. 
    This class should always be inherited when you build a new camera.

[ArrayCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/cameras/ArrayCamera)

    ArrayCamera can be used in order to efficiently render a scene with a predefined set of cameras.
    This is an important performance aspect for rendering VR scenes.
    An instance of ArrayCamera always has an array of sub cameras.
    It's mandatory to define for each sub camera the viewport property which determines the part of the viewport that is rendered with this camera.

[StereoCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/cameras/StereoCamera)

    Dual PerspectiveCameras used for effects such as 3D Anaglyph or Parallax Barrier.

[CubeCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/cameras/CubeCamera)

    Creates 6 cameras that render to a WebGLCubeRenderTarget.

[OrthoGraphicCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/cameras/OrthographicCamera)

    In this projection mode, an object's size in the rendered image stays constant regardless of its distance from the camera.

    This can be useful for rendering 2D scenes and UI elements, amongst other things.

[FlyControls](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/FlyControls)

    FlyControls enables a navigation similar to fly modes in DCC tools like Blender. You can arbitrarily transform the camera in 3D space without any limitations (e.g. focus on a specific target).

[FirstPersonControl](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/FirstPersonControls)

    This class is an alternative implementation of FlyControls.

[PointerLockControl](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/PointerLockControls)

    The implementation of this class is based on the Pointer Lock API. PointerLockControls is a perfect choice for first person 3D games.

[OrbitControl](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/OrbitControls)

    Orbit controls allow the camera to orbit around a target.
    To use this, as with all files in the /examples directory, you will have to include the file separately in your HTML.

[TrackBallControl](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/TrackballControls)

    TrackballControls is similar to OrbitControls. However, it does not maintain a constant camera up vector. That means if the camera orbits over the “north” and “south” poles, it does not flip to stay "right side up".

[TransformControls](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/TransformControls)

    This class can be used to transform objects in 3D space by adapting a similar interaction model of DCC tools like Blender.
    Unlike other controls, it is not intended to transform the scene's camera.

    TransformControls expects that its attached 3D object is part of the scene graph.

[DragControls](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/DragControls)

    This class can be used to provide a drag'n'drop interaction.

[Pointer Lock API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_Lock_API)

### 1.6: **Geometries**

[BufferGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/core/BufferGeometry)

    A representation of mesh, line, or point geometry.
    Includes vertex positions, face indices, normals, colors, UVs, and custom attributes within buffers, reducing the cost of passing all this data to the GPU.

    To read and edit data in BufferGeometry attributes, see BufferAttribute documentation.

[PlaneGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/PlaneGeometry)

    A class for generating plane geometries

[circleGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/CircleGeometry)

    CircleGeometry is a simple shape of Euclidean geometry. It is constructed from a number of triangular segments that are oriented around a central point and extend as far out as a given radius. It is built counter-clockwise from a start angle and a given central angle. It can also be used to create regular polygons, where the number of segments determines the number of sides.

    Creates an one-sided polygonal geometry from one or more path shapes.

[TubeGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/TubeGeometry)

    Creates a tube that extrudes along a 3d curve.

[LatheGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/LatheGeometry)

    Creates meshes with axial symmetry like vases. The lathe rotates around the Y axis.

[TextGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=textge#examples/en/geometries/TextGeometry)

    A class for generating text as a single geometry.
    It is constructed by providing a string of text, and a set of parameters consisting of a loaded font and settings for the geometry's parent ExtrudeGeometry

[Float32Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Float32Array)

    Treats the array the same as a float array in the c language

### 1.7: **Textures**

[Texture](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/textures/Texture)

    Create a texture to apply to a surface or as a reflection or refraction map.

    Note: After the initial use of a texture, its dimensions, format, and type cannot be changed.
    Instead, call .dispose() on the texture and instantiate a new one.

[TextureLoader](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/loaders/TextureLoader)

    Class for loading a texture. This uses the ImageLoader internally for loading files.

[LoadingManger](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/loaders/managers/LoadingManager)

    Handles and keeps track of loaded and pending data. A default global instance of this class is created and used by loaders if not supplied manually - see DefaultLoadingManager.

    In general that should be sufficient, however there are times when it can be useful to have separate loaders - for example if you want to show separate loading bars for objects and textures.

[Vector2](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/math/Vector2)

    Class representing a 2D vector.
    A 2D vector is an ordered pair of numbers (labeled x and y), which can be used to represent a number of things

### 1.8: **Materials**

[MeshNormalMaterial](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/MeshNormalMaterial)

    A material that maps the normal vectors to RGB colors.

[MeshDepthMaterial](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/materials/MeshDepthMaterial)

    A material for drawing geometry by depth.
    Depth is based off of the camera near and far plane.
    White is nearest, black is farthest.

[MeshMatcapMaterial](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/MeshMatcapMaterial)

    MeshMatcapMaterial is defined by a MatCap (or Lit Sphere) texture, which encodes the material color and shading.

    MeshMatcapMaterial does not respond to lights since the matcap image file encodes baked lighting.
    It will cast a shadow onto an object that receives shadows (and shadow clipping works), but it will not self-shadow or receive shadows.

[ambientLight](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/lights/AmbientLight)

    This light globally illuminates all objects in the scene equally.

    This light cannot be used to cast shadows as it does not have a direction.

[PointLight](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/lights/PointLight)

    A light that gets emitted from a single point in all directions. A common use case for this is to replicate the light emitted from a bare lightbulb.

    This light can cast shadows - see PointLightShadow page for details.

[MeshLambertMaterial](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/MeshLambertMaterial)

    A material for non-shiny surfaces, without specular highlights.

    The material uses a non-physically based Lambertian model for calculating reflectance.
    This can simulate some surfaces (such as untreated wood or stone) well, but cannot simulate shiny surfaces with specular highlights (such as varnished wood).
    MeshLambertMaterial uses per-fragment shading.

[MeshPhongMaterial](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/MeshPhongMaterial)

    The material uses a non-physically based Blinn-Phong model for calculating reflectance.
    Unlike the Lambertian model used in the MeshLambertMaterial this can simulate shiny surfaces with specular highlights (such as varnished wood).
    MeshPhongMaterial uses per-fragment shading.

[MeshToonMaterial](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/MeshToonMaterial)

    A material for implimenting toon shading

[MeshStandardMaterial](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/MeshStandardMaterial)

    An extension of the MeshStandardMaterial, providing more advanced physically-based rendering properties

[ShaderMaterial](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/materials/ShaderMaterial)

    A material rendered with custom shaders. A shader is a small program written in GLSL that runs on the GPU. You may want to use a custom shader if you need to:

    • implement an effect not included with any of the built-in materials
    • combine many objects into a single BufferGeometry in order to improve performance

[RawShaderMaterial](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/materials/RawShaderMaterial)

    This class works just like ShaderMaterial, except that definitions of built-in uniforms and attributes are not automatically prepended to the GLSL shader code.

[CubeTextureLoader](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/loaders/CubeTextureLoader)

    CubeTextureLoader can be used to load cube maps.
    The loader returns an instance of CubeTexture and expects the cube map to be defined as six separate images representing the sides of a cube.
    Other cube map definitions like vertical and horizontal cross, column and row layouts are not supported.

## 1.9: **3D Text project**

[FontLoader](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/loaders/FontLoader)

    Class for loading a font in JSON format. Returns a font, which is an array of Shapes representing the font. This uses the FileLoader internally for loading files.

[BoxThree](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/math/Box3)

    Represents an axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) in 3D space.

## ***Chapter 2:***

### 2.1: Lights

[DirectionalLight](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/lights/DirectionalLight)

    A light that gets emitted in a specific direction. This light will behave as though it is infinitely far away and the rays produced from it are all parallel. The common use case for this is to simulate daylight; the sun is far enough away that its position can be considered to be infinite, and all light rays coming from it are parallel.

[RectAreaLight](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/lights/RectAreaLight)

    RectAreaLight emits light uniformly across the face a rectangular plane. This light type can be used to simulate light sources such as bright windows or strip li

[SpotLight](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/lights/SpotLight)

    This light gets emitted from a single point in one direction, along a cone that increases in size the further from the light it gets.

[HemisphereLightHelper](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/helpers/HemisphereLightHelper)

    Creates a visual aid consisting of a spherical Mesh for a HemisphereLight.

[DirectionalLightHelper](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/helpers/DirectionalLightHelper)

    Helper object to assist with visualizing a DirectionalLight's effect on the scene. This consists of plane and a line representing the light's position and direction.

[PointLightHelper](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/helpers/PointLightHelper)

    This displays a helper object consisting of a spherical Mesh for visualizing a PointLight.

[RectAreaLightHelper](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#examples/en/helpers/RectAreaLightHelper)

    Creates a visual aid for a RectAreaLight.

### 2.2: **Shadows**

    [shadowMaps(Example)](https://threejs.org/examples/webgl_shadowmap_viewer.html)

### 2.3: **Particles**

[PointsMaterial](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/PointsMaterial)

    The default material used by points

[Points](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/objects/Points)

    A class for displaying points.
    The points are rendered by the WebGLRenderer using gl.POINTS.
